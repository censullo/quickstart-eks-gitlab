The result of this automation is a completely operational {partner-product-short-name} Instance.

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or three Availability Zones. ^[AWS-WA]^
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.^1^ ^[AWS-WA]^

=== Bundled Provisioning of Container Registry, Backup, Log Aggregation and Monitoring
- Uses Amazon Linux 2 throughout - which benefits from Amazon specific optimizations for performance and compute density for both EKS and EC2 hosts. ^[AWS-WA]^
- All {partner-product-short-name} logs are automatically aggregated into CloudWatch logs via CloudWatch Instance Agent and CloudWatch Container Insights. ^[AWS-WA]^
- EKS workload monitoring via CloudWatch Container Insights. ^[AWS-WA]^
- {partner-product-short-name} backup is preconfigured.
- Prometheus is always deployed with the {partner-product-short-name} instance.
- Setting "ConfigureGrafana" also deploys and configures Grafana. ^[AWS-WA]^
- The container registry is automatically setup at `registry.[subdomain]` ^[AWS-WA]^

=== Security

==== Application Secrets
** Stores generated secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (e.g. generates a proper initial root password) ^[AWS-WA]^

==== EKS Cluster Administration
The {partner-product-short-name} Kubernetes endpoint can be private, a bastion host must be deployed in order to do direct cluster management (it will be preloaded with AWS, EKS and Kubernetes management utilities and IAM permissions for cluster management). The bastion host is setup with SSH keys, but can also be accessed more securely using the preconfigured SSM Session Manager. Additionally, the bastion host has command audit logging enabled and the log is uploaded to CloudWatch.

==== Data Encryption

* Data in Transit:
** SSL for front end http. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to S3. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to PostgreSQL RDS. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to Redis Elasticache. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to Runner. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL Not Yet Available for {partner-product-short-name} to Praefect to Gitaly. ^[AWS-WA]^
* Data at Rest (AWS Managed Keys):
** S3 Encryption ^[AWS-WA]^
** PostgreSQL RDS Encryption ^[AWS-WA]^
** Redis Elasticache Encryption ^[AWS-WA]^
** Gitaly EBS Encryption (Git File System) ^[AWS-WA]^
** Praefect Data (PostgreSQL RDS). ^[AWS-WA]^

=== Database
{partner-product-short-name} Quickstart deploys Highly Available PostgreSQL database cluster using https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/aurora-postgresql/[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Quickstart^].

Depending on the projected size of your {partner-product-short-name} deployment you may want to adjust database instance size using *DBInstanceClass* parameter.

There are two databases deployed to the same cluster:

* {partner-product-short-name} database
* Praefect tracking database

Praefect requires a separate tracking database as described in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html[Gitaly Cluster documentation^]. 

More about external database configuration in https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-db/[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].

=== {partner-product-short-name} Storage

==== Git repository storage
* EBS Volumes on Gitaly Cluster instances. ^[GL-RAR]

==== Object storage for {partner-product-short-name} storage types.
{partner-product-short-name} Quickstart creates the following S3 buckets:

* ArtifactsBucket
* LfsBucket
* UploadsBucket
* PackagesBucket
* TerraformBucket
* PseudonymizerBucket
* RegistryBucket
* BackupBucket
* BackupTempBucket

S3 policies can be applied to these storages for retentions, storage tier management, cleanup and out of region replication.

Contents of the bucket encrypted by default with SSE-S3. Names of the buckets are generated by CloudFormation and exported as SSM parameters (see *Exports* section).

More about external object storage in https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-object-storage/[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].

=== {partner-product-short-name} Backups

==== Scheduling Backups

Backup schedule is controlled by cron expression and default value is `pass:[0 1 * * * *]` (daily at 1am). You can set a different schedule using *BackupSchedule* parameter.

==== Content of the backups

Backups include {partner-product-short-name} database snapshot and contents of {partner-product-short-name} projects (Git repositories, Wiki pages). Backups do *not* include contents of S3 buckets (see Object storage for a list of buckets). The main reason behind this decision:

* Contents of these buckets may be very large (pipeline artifacts, docker images, etc.) and that may affect stability and performance of the backup jobs
* S3 is a https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#Durability_.26_Data_Protection[durable storage^]
* S3 storage policies also enable out of region replication and management of storage class migration to control costs for older data.

If needed, complete backup may be created using backup-utility as described in https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/backup-restore/[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].

==== Backup/Restore resources

NOTE: Disk volume required for backups is about *2x larger than backup tarball itself*. This is due to the fact that all resources have to be downloaded first and packaged to tarball file which also stored locally. Consider the size of you {partner-product-short-name} database and projects (mainly Git repositories) to set the size of the underlying EBS volumes appropriately using *BackupVolumeSize* parameter.

Default Quick Start configuration tested on backups of 20Gb average size, took about 30 minutes to create and upload to S3 bucket.

For large {partner-product-short-name} deployments you can also adjust CPU and memory requirements for backup and restore pods using *BackupCpu* and *BackupMemory* parameters.

More about backups in https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/backup-restore/[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].

=== {partner-product-short-name} Telemetry and Monitoring
=== CloudWatch Container Insights
{partner-product-short-name} Quickstart integrates EKS cluster with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html[CloudWatch Container Insights^] to collect, aggregate, and summarise metrics and logs if *ConfigureContainerInsights* parameter is set to `Yes`.

Logs and metrics can be accessed from CloudWatch console:

.CloudWatch Container Insights
image::../images/cloudwatch-container-insights.png[CloudWatch Container Insights,width=100%,height=100%]

==== Prometheus metrics
{partner-product-short-name} exposes Prometheus metrics under `/-/metrics` of the {partner-product-short-name} Ingress. Optional Grafana integration can be enabled by setting *ConfigureGrafana* parameter to ‘Yes’.

More about Grafana integration in https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/globals.html#configure-grafana-integration[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].

==== Amazon EKS Console
Amazon EKS Console gives you a single place to see the status of your Kubernetes clusters, applications, and associated cloud resources.

Please see the prerequisites for Amazon EKS Console access configuration in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/view-workloads.html[AWS documentation^].
