//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a partner account. If there are no predeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

=== {partner-product-short-name} instance version selection

The version of {partner-product-short-name} that will be deployed depends on the {partner-product-short-name} Helm chart version you select when launching this Quick Start. Here is the https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/version_mappings.html[documentation for mapping {partner-product-short-name} Helm chart versions to {partner-product-short-name} product versions^].

=== {partner-product-short-name} migrations and versions

If you are migrating an existing {partner-product-short-name} instance to one built by this Quick Start, it is critical to have the new instance version match the old instance version during migration. {partner-product-short-name} version upgrades can be done on the old instance before migration or on the new instance after migration - but not during a migration using mismatched versions. **This includes the versions of all underlying components such as PostgreSQL and Redis.**

=== {partner-product-short-name} internet ingress

The {partner-product-short-name} instance will be configured with an internet ingress by default.

=== Planning instances types, sizes, and numbers

This Quick Start is capable of creating {partner-product-short-name} cloud native reference architecture compliant {partner-product-short-name} instances. {partner-product-short-name} reference architectures have a "Cloud Native Hybrid" section that gives a manifest of required resources that can be used while deploying the template.

=== Planning post-installation considerations

The following items need to be deployed after the {partner-product-short-name} instance is operational. They are noted here so that plans can be made around deploying them. Further instructions are available in the following <<Postdeployment steps>> sections:

* <<Integrating with existing clusters>>
* <<Kubernetes cluster provisioning>>

==== Deploying {partner-product-short-name} Runners

For a production deployment, the Kubernetes Runner chart integrated into the Quick Start should not be deployed because it deploys to the same cluster as {partner-product-short-name}. This can create workload scaling challenges and should never be done with privileged mode enabled because it gives very high privileges to the cluster for any Runner job. However, without privileged mode, AutoDevOps, Review Apps and DinD based container builds will not work (Kaniko based container builds can work) - so a separate {partner-product-short-name} Runner design and deployment is advised.

Alternative {partner-product-short-name} Runner deployment options include:

. For groups and projects that will be integrated into a Kubernetes cluster dedicated to development and/or production, the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/applications.html#gitlab-runner[{partner-product-short-name} Runner can be deployed as a managed app^] or using the https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html[Runner Helm chart^] after the clusters are integrated.
. For non-Kubernetes integrated groups, projects or for shared runners for the entire instance, the https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/aws/gitlab-runner-autoscaling-aws-asg[{partner-product-short-name} HA scaling Runner vending machine for AWS^] can be used to deploy runners of all OS types and Runner Executor types using an AWS ASG.
. Another option is to implement a dedicated EKS cluster for a fleet of shared runners.
